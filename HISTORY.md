Alpha10. Alpha register is open to feedback
August 2017

The occupations register remains open for feedback.

Due to restrictions on publishing in the run-up to the General Election in June 2017 we did not publish a blog post at the time the register moved into alpha. We have been notified by the current custodian on 16th August that there will be change of circumstances meaning that WEF 7th September there will be a new custodian in place - name TBC. As we have a blog post almost ready to publish the current custodian would rather delay publishing until September when the new custodian will be confirmed and their details can be updated to the post.

The occupations register moved into alpha on 11th May and is now open for feedback.

For the alpha register, any updates that are required to the data will be made by the GDS registers team following agreement with the registerâ€™s custodian. When the register moves into beta the GDS registers team will support the custodian to update their register including providing tools to make it easy for the custodian to manage register updates.
Discovery6. Review how feedback is collected
April 2017

There will be a link to provide feedback at the top of each page of the alpha occupations register. All feedback will be sent to the registers team at GDS. Both the registers team and the custodian will respond to feedback, depending on whether it relates to the registers product or the data.
Discovery5. Find duplicate lists
April 2017

While producing this register we looked at a number of similar but subtly different lists of Standard Occupational Classification codes and worked with the custodian to identify the correct data to go in the register, where there was discrepencies across different lists.
